This Belizean History Course has taught me a lot about our past, and our role we play in the grander scheme of things.
The topics I've found most interesting and significant is of the ancient civilization of the Mayas. Like many other countries,
such as Egypt, India, Greece and so on, they too have advanced ancient civilizations who have done astonishing things that
still left them bewildered and in awe as to how they've managed to bring together societies governed by intricate sciences.
In the case of the Mayan, we've made many discoveries and uncovered many artifacts and manuscripts that are a true 
testament to the Mayan's knowledge in science. The Mayans were also known for their agricultural practices such as 
slash and burn and other things like terrace systems and drainage canals. Other things their known for is their mathematics system
and calendar and their advanced understanding in astronomy. Many of the practices and knowledge from ancient civilizations 
are still used to this day, which really shows the significance of their pioneering through history. Because of their efforts 
and their unfortunate downfalls throughout history we are able to learn and utilize their works. For example we can keep
track of the time by looking at our watches or our phones, the Mayans kept track of time and many significant seasons and times
of the year by tracking the sun and the planets. Another reason why we should be grateful and acknowledge the Mayans and 
many other ancient civilizations because they've paved the road for us to continue develop.
